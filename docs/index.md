# Introduction

Userfront is built to make startups more likely to succeed, focusing on three areas:

1. [**Auth**](/auth.html) - In about 10 minutes, add signup, login, password reset, and more to any website. Install by copy/pasting a snippet of code into your website's HTML.

2. [**Startup metrics**](/dashboard.html) - When your users sign up or use your site, their activity is automatically shown in your dashboard. There you can manage their data, view activity, send them messages, and more.

3. [**Automated messaging**](/messaging.html) - Use automation to grow your user base, with triggers based on user activity. You can customize campaigns for when a user first signs up, takes a certain action, goes inactive, and more.

Userfront works with **ANY** website, regardless of what technology your site uses. You can add it to existing projects to supercharge them, or can build a new project on whatever platform you prefer.
