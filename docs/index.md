# Introduction

Userfront is built to make startups more likely to succeed, focusing on three areas:

1. [**10-minute Auth**](/auth.html) lets you add signup, login, and password reset to any website by copy/pasting a snippet of code into your HTML.

2. [**Startup metrics**](/dashboard.html) improve your decision making and make it easy to share your progress with investors.

3. [**Automated messaging**](/messaging.html) helps you onboard users and keep them engaged, for better retention and faster growth.

:::tip
Userfront works with **ANY** website or app, regardless of what technology you use. You can add it to existing projects to supercharge them, or can build a new project on whatever platform you prefer.

Try the [Quickstart](/quickstart.html) to get up and running quickly.
