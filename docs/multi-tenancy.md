# Multi-tenancy

Multi-tenancy allows you to sub-divide your application so that your users can have their own projects, teams, and organizations. The term "tenant" refers to one of these projects, teams, or organizations.

Within a tenant, you can assign roles to your users.

Users can have multiple roles within a tenant, and users can also have roles in more than one tenant.
