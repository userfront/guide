# Introduction

Userfront makes it easy to onboard & engage your users, focusing on 3 areas:

1. [**Onboarding (auth)**](/guide/auth.html) - Userfront has ready-to-use forms for signup, login, password reset, and more. These are copy/pasted into your website's HTML and don't require any backend to work.

2. [**User dashboard**](/guide/dashboard.html) - When your users sign up or use your site, their activity is automatically shown in your dashboard. There you can manage their data, view activity, send them messages, and more.

3. [**Automated messaging**](/guide/messaging.html) - Use automations to grow your user base, with triggers based on user activity. You can customize campaigns for when a user first signs up, takes a certain action, goes inactive, and more.

Userfront works with **ANY** website, regardless of what technology your site uses. You can add it to existing projects to supercharge them, or can build a new project on whatever platform you prefer.
