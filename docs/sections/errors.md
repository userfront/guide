## Errors

::::: row
:::: left

Userfront uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.). Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Userfront's servers (these are rare).

Some `4xx` errors that could be handled programmatically (e.g. a token is expired) include an error code that briefly explains the error reported.

#### HTTP Status Code Summary

|                             |                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|                **200 - OK** | Everything worked as expected.                                                                   |
|       **400 - Bad Request** | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.                         |
|      **401 - Unauthorized** | No valid API key provided.                                                                       |
|    **402 - Request Failed** | The parameters were valid but the request failed.                                                |
|         **403 - Forbidden** | The API key doesn't have permissions to perform the request.                                     |
|         **404 - Not Found** | The requested resource doesn't exist.                                                            |
| **429 - Too Many Requests** | Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests. |
|      **500 - Server Error** | Something went wrong on Userfront's end. (These are rare.)                                       |
